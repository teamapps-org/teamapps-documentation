  <h3 id="TemplatesAndDataExtraction">Templates and Data Extraction</h3>

  <h4 id="GeneralConcept">General concept</h4>
  <p>
    This section shows how any kind of object can be displayed within TeamApps UI components in a custom way.
    To achieve this, we use Templates and data extraction tools. In the below example, the general principle is applied
    to the simplest component, the TemplateField, where we want to display an Animal object. <br>
    Templates define how data properties are displayed on the UI. The set of properties a template is based on can be
    accessed via the {getPropertyNames} method which every template must implement. Here, we use one of the predefined
    BaseTemplates which are based on the GridTemplate (see section <a href="#GridTemplate">Grid Template</a>).
    The BaseTemplate FILE_ITEM_FLOATING has the propertyNames: [icon, image, caption, description, badge,
    ariaLabel, title]. <br>
    Data extraction tools comprise the PropertyProvider and its subinterface the PropertyExtractor. Both serve as
    mappers of the templates propertyNames to object specific information (e.g. its attributes) we want to display.
    Below, we implement a PropertyExtractor by defining this mapping in its {getValue} method. The PropertyProvider has
    a similar mapping function called {getValues} which returns a mapping of all propertyNames at once. <br>
    Note: in the example below, the title occurs in the mouseover popup.
  </p>
  <example th:with="class='org.teamapps.documentation.example.templates.TemplateFieldExample'"></example>
  <p>
    If no custom PropertyProvider or Extractor is set in a component, the BeanPropertyExtractor which implements the
    PropertyExtractor is used as a default. Its {getValue} method is based on the ValueExtractor interface whose instances
    are record class and propertyName specific. More precisely, its {extract} method returns the respective
    propertyName specific value for a record. <br>
    If there is no custom ValueExtractor for a given propertyName in a BeanPropertyExtractor instance, a
    ValueExtractor is created for the class of the record and the propertyName if a getter named according to the
    propertyName can be found within the class (and if fallbackToFields attribute is True, it also tries to match the
    field names of the class). Thus, in the example, description and icon of the animal class would be displayed
    automatically, since the attribute names match the propertyNames.
    However, a template's propertyNames are not suitable as attribute names of the Objects that should be represented.
    In that case, we can either define a custom PropertyProvider or extractor as in the previous example or alternatively
    add custom ValueExtractors for specific propertyNames to the BeanPropertyExtractor via the {addProperty} method. In
    the below example, we pass ValueExtractors for the caption, image and badge properties.

  <h6 id="MustacheTemplate">Mustache Template</h6>
  <p>
    The MustacheTemplate is instantiated with a html string that the property names are extracted from. This
    is done by applying a regular expression that splits the html string at curly braces. In the below example,
    the property names color, iconSize, icon and caption are thus extracted. At the same time, the html string
    also defines the way the properties of the records are displayed in the ComboBox.

  <h4 id="ComboBoxWithTemplate">ComboBox with Template</h4>
  <p>
    For general use of ComboBoxes, please refer to the section <a href="Fields#ComboBoxFields">ComboBoxFields</a>
    To display the records in a defined way, we use the BaseTemplate.LIST_ITEM_LARGE_ICON_TWO_LINES which has the
    following list of property names: [icon, image, caption, description, badge, ariaLabel, title].

  <h6 id="TemplateDecider">TemplateDecider</h6>
  <p>
    It is possible to set different templates for different records. For that purpose, you can set a general
    TemplateDecider, but you can also further distinguish between the records in the drop-down list and the
    record selected by the user which is demonstrated below.
  </p>
  <example th:with="class='org.teamapps.documentation.example.combobox.ComboBoxTemplateDecider'"></example>
  <h4 id="ButtonWithTemplate">Button with Template</h4>
  <p>
    The main features to display on a button might be an icon and a caption. There are factory methods where you can
    pass just (one of) these parameters and a BaseTemplateRecord will be created from them as the record entry of the
    button and BaseTemplate called BUTTON will be used for display. We can also add a Component which expands upon
    clicking the button. This is shown in the upper button example. <br>
    Like in previously presented components, we can also display a custom record object on a button. For the arrangement
    of the properties, we can for instance use one of the several button related predefined BaseTemplates and use set a
    propertyProvider that maps selected information of the record onto the button (see second button example).
    In a later section, we will see how to use buttons in a <a href="#ToolbarWithTemplate">toolbar with templates</a>.

  <h4 id="ItemViewWithTemplate">ItemView with Template</h4>
  <p>
    An ItemView object contains a List of ItemGroups. Both have the same two generic Types, RECORD and a HEADERRECORD.
    Accordingly, an ItemGroup object contains an items list of RECORDS and a headerRecord as attributes. The default
    BaseTemplate of the groupHeader, the LIST_ITEM_SMALL_ICON_SINGLE_LINE, is set in the ItemView class  and the default
    BaseTemplate of the items, the ITEM_VIEW_ITEM, is set in ItemGroup class.
